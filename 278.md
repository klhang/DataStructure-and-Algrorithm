## LeetCode 278

### Description

You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.
Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.
You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which will return whether version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

### Thought
The idea is to treaverse the array and check each to see if it is good or bad. Time complexity would be O(n).

A faster way is to use binary search, each time check mid of the array, if element is good or bad, then update the start or end of the scope. In this way we can abandon half of the array each time. Time complexity would be O(log N)

### Solution
```java
public class Solution extends VersionControl {
    public int firstBadVersion(int n) {
      int start = 1;
      int end = n;

      while(end > start){
        int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
        if (isBadVersion(mid)) {
          end = mid;
        } else {
          start = mid + 1;
        }
      }

    return start;
    }
}
```
