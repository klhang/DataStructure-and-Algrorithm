## LeetCode 156

### Description
Given a binary tree where all the right nodes are either leaf nodes with a sibling (a left node that shares the same parent node) or empty, flip it upside down and turn it into a tree where the original right nodes turned into left leaf nodes. Return the new root.

For example:
Given a binary tree {1,2,3,4,5},

    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \
4   5


return the root of the binary tree [4,5,2,#,#,3,1].

   4
  / \
 5   2
    / \
   3   1  

### Thought
By draw the tree, we can find that all we need to do is to:
1. Eventually we need to return the left most child(4) as the new root.
2. reset the pointer from new root to its left child and right child
3. call the operation recursively until there is no node or the left child of a node is null

### Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode upsideDownBinaryTree(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null || root.left == null){
            return root;
        }
        TreeNode newNode = upsideDownBinaryTree(root.left);
        
        root.left.left = root.right;
        root.left.right = root;
        root.left = null;
        root.right = null;

        return newNode;
    }
}
```

### Takeaways
* Eventually we need to return the left most child(4) as the new root.]
* Time complexity O(n)，space complexity：O(1) in place
