## LeetCode 94

### Description
Given a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.

Example:

Input: [1,null,2,3]
   1
    \
     2
    /
   3

Output: [1,3,2]

### Thought
1. Because tree nodes are connected by one direction pointer, so after getting the left node, we cannot get back to the parent, so first of all, we need a data structure to record all the path. Stack.

2. After analysis and drawing, it is actually a DFS, and I find that we first need to push all left nodes to stack until we reach the leaf, then we pop the first node out.

3. Now we need to do couple things: first, add it to the result; second, check if it has right node, apply the push process to its right node if it has one.

### Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> inorderTraversal(TreeNode root) {
        List<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>();
        Deque<TreeNode> deque = new ArrayDeque<>();
        pushLeftNodes(root, deque);

        while(!deque.isEmpty()){
          TreeNode curr = deque.removeFirst();
          res.add(curr.val);

          pushLeftNodes(curr.right, deque);
        }

        return res;
    }

    private void pushLeftNodes(TreeNode node, Deque<TreeNode> deque){
      while(node != null){
        deque.addFirst(node);
        node = node.left;
      }
    }
}
```
