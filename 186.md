## LeetCode 186

### Description
Given an input string, reverse the string word by word. A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.

The input string does not contain leading or trailing spaces and the words are always separated by a single space.

For example,
Given s = "the sky is blue",
return "blue is sky the".

Could you do it in-place without allocating extra space?

### Thought
We can reverse the whole string first and then reverse the words one by one.
Time complexity: O(n);
Space complexity: O(1);


### Solution
```java
public void reverseString(char[] str) {
  //use helper function to reverse whole string
  reverse(str, 0, str.length-1);

  //use for loop to reverse each word of the reversed string
  int start = 0;
  for (int pos = 0; pos < str.length; pos++) {
    if (str[pos] == " ") { //find words by " ", and apply reverse function
      reverse(str, start, pos - 1);
      start = pos + 1; //reset start for the next word
    }
  }

  //the for loop above will left the last word unreversed, so reverse one more time
  reverse(str, start, str.length-1);
}

public void reverse(char[] str, int start, int end) {
  while (start < end) {
    char temp = str[start];
    str[start] = str[end];
    str[end] = tem;
    start++;
    end--;
  }
}
```

### Takeaways
* Array in-place operation use swap
