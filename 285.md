## LeetCode 285

### Description

Given a binary search tree and a node in it, find the in-order successor of that node in the BST.

Note: If the given node has no in-order successor in the tree, return null.

Example 1:

Input: root = [2,1,3], p = 1

  2
 / \
1   3

Output: 2

### Solution I
```java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode inorderSuccessor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p) {
        //find next node of curr node when doing successor
        //use stack to do inorder traversal
        //when pop, check if curr = p, if yes, then check if curr has right node
        //if has right node, then apply pushleft on right node
        //if not, then pop()
        Stack<TreeNode> stack = new Stack<>();
        pushLeftNodes(root, stack);

        while(!stack.isEmpty()){
            TreeNode curr = stack.pop();
            if (curr.right != null){
                pushLeftNodes(curr.right, stack);
            }
            if (curr == p){
                if (stack.isEmpty()){
                    return null;
                }
                return stack.pop();
            }
        }
        return null;
    }

    public void pushLeftNodes(TreeNode root, Stack<TreeNode> stack){
        while(root != null){
            stack.push(root);
            root = root.left;
        }
    }
}
```
### Solution II --- find successor and predecessor of node in BST
```java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode inorderSuccessor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p) {
        // inorder of bst is in acsend order
        // if root > target, root can be sucess, root = root.left
        // if root <= target, root = root.right;

        TreeNode succ = null;
        while (root != null){
            if (p.val < root.val){
                succ = root;
                root = root.left;
            } else {
                root = root.right;
            }
        }
        return succ;
    }
}
```
### Takeaways
* 精巧方法找 find successor and predecessor of node in BST
* note: The inorder traversal of a BST is the nodes in ascending order. To find a successor, you just need to find the smallest one that is larger than the given value since there are no duplicate values in a BST. It just like the binary search in a sorted list. The time complexity should be O(h) where h is the depth of the result node. succ is a pointer that keeps the possible successor. Whenever you go left the current root is the new possible successor, otherwise the it remains the same.

Only in a balanced BST O(h) = O(log n). In the worst case h can be as large as n.
