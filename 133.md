## LeetCode 133

### Description
Clone an undirected graph. Each node in the graph contains a label and a list of its neighbors.


OJ's undirected graph serialization:
Nodes are labeled uniquely.

We use # as a separator for each node, and , as a separator for node label and each neighbor of the node.
As an example, consider the serialized graph {0,1,2#1,2#2,2}.

The graph has a total of three nodes, and therefore contains three parts as separated by #.

First node is labeled as 0. Connect node 0 to both nodes 1 and 2.
Second node is labeled as 1. Connect node 1 to node 2.
Third node is labeled as 2. Connect node 2 to node 2 (itself), thus forming a self-cycle.
Visually, the graph looks like the following:

       1
      / \
     /   \
    0 --- 2
         / \
         \_/


### Solution
```java
public UndirectedGraphNode cloneGraph(UndirectedGraphNode root) {
  if (root == null) return null;

  // use a queue to help BFS
  Queue<UndirectedGraphNode> queue = new LinkedList<UndirectedGraphNode>();
  queue.add(root);

  // use a map to save cloned nodes
  Map<UndirectedGraphNode, UndirectedGraphNode> map = new HashMap<UndirectedGraphNode, UndirectedGraphNode>();

  // clone the root
  map.put(root, new UndirectedGraphNode(root.label));

  while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
    UndirectedGraphNode node = queue.poll();

    // handle the neighbors
    for (UndirectedGraphNode neighbor : node.neighbors) {
      if (!map.containsKey(neighbor)) {
        // clone the neighbor
        map.put(neighbor, new UndirectedGraphNode(neighbor.label));
        // add it to the next level
        queue.add(neighbor);
      }

      // copy the neighbor
      map.get(node).neighbors.add(map.get(neighbor));
    }
  }

  return map.get(root);
}
```
