## LeetCode 207

### Description
There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n-1.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

Example 1:

Input: 2, [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take.
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
Example 2:

Input: 2, [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take.
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
             also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.

### Thought
A. DFS遍历，mark visited, if successor is visited, then means circle

B. 找环, 入度为零放入queue，逐步删除入度为0的node，并记录count，下面node入度减1
1. 如果有环，就死循环，就不能，演变为找环问题
2. 入度为零的课先上，n 变为 n-1
3. 终止条件为，count = course num, take all the courses

### Solution - 入度
```java
class Solution{
  public boolean canFinish(int numCourse, int[][]prerequisites){
    //save dependencies
    List<Integer>[] neighbors = new List[numCourse];
    //save the indegree of each node
    int[] degree = new int[numCourse];

    for (int[] path: prerequisites) {
      neighbors[path[1]].add(path[0]);
      ++degree[path[0]];
    }

    Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < numCourse; i++) {
      //if indegree is 0, add to the queue
      if (degree[i] == 0) {
        q.offer(i);
      }
    }

    int count = 0;

    while (!q.isEmpty()){
      for (int node: neighbors[q.poll()]) {
        //get the dependencies of the 0indegree node, and reduce its indegree by 1
        //if its indegree is 0, add to the queue, and add count.
        if (--degree[node] == 0) {
          q.offer(node);
        }
      }
      ++count;
    }

    return count == numCourse;
  }
}
```

### Solution - DFS
``` java

public class Solution {
  class Solution {
      public boolean canFinish(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites) {
          //get the adjList
          List<List<Integer>> adjList = new ArrayList<>();
          for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++){
              adjList.add(new ArrayList<Integer>());
          }

          for (int[] edge: prerequisites){
              //[1, 0]
              adjList.get(edge[1]).add(edge[0]);
          }

          //status
          int[] status= new int[numCourses];

          //dfs
          for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++){
              if (isCycleExist(i, adjList, status)){
                  return false;
              }
          }

          return true;
      }

      private boolean isCycleExist(int curr, List<List<Integer>> adjList, int[] status){
          //0 means visiting, 1 means visited, 2 means checked
          if  (status[curr] == 1){
              return true;
          }
          if (status[curr] == 2){
              return false;
          }

          //recursive step
          status[curr] = 1;
          for (int succ: adjList.get(curr)){
              if  (isCycleExist(succ, adjList, status)){
                  return true;
              }
          }

          status[curr] = 2;
          return false;
      }
  }
```

### Takeaways
1. BFS dfs, 优先search(入度为0的节点) or （花费最低的节点）-》 greedy

2. 207 找环——》 yes or no；
   210 构建-》solution

3. DAG， indegree， topological
When there is cycle in directed graph, there is no topological order.

4. graph三种表达形式： list of edges， adjacency matrices

5. space and time complexity
BFS-
Time complexity for this approach is O(e + v), where e is number of edges, v is number of
vertices.
● O(e) to go through each of the edges and build adjacency list(neighbor);
● O(e + v) to traverse the graph - each node is being enqued and dequed, and every edge
is removed.

Space complexity is O(e + v).
● O(v + e) to store adjacency list.
● O(v) to store indegree for each node.

DFS
Time complexity for this approach is O(e + v):
● O(e) to build adjacency list;
● O(e + v) to traverse the graph, as every node and every edge is visited once.
Space complexity for this approach is O(e + v):
● O(v + e) to store adjacency list;
● O(v) to store isVisited indicator.
