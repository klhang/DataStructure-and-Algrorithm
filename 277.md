## LeetCode 277

### Description
Suppose you are at a party with n people (labeled from 0 to n - 1) and among them, there may exist one celebrity. The definition of a celebrity is that all the other n - 1 people know him/her but he/she does not know any of them.

Now you want to find out who the celebrity is or verify that there is not one. The only thing you are allowed to do is to ask questions like: "Hi, A. Do you know B?" to get information of whether A knows B. You need to find out the celebrity (or verify there is not one) by asking as few questions as possible (in the asymptotic sense).

You are given a helper function bool knows(a, b) which tells you whether A knows B. Implement a function int findCelebrity(n), your function should minimize the number of calls to knows.

Note: There will be exactly one celebrity if he/she is in the party. Return the celebrity's label if there is a celebrity in the party. If there is no celebrity, return -1.

### Thought
1. we can solve it by checking each pair of them, using forloop, O(n^2)

2. The trick is that when we use the knows function, we can get infos like:
  a. if A knows B, B must not be the celeb
  b. if B Knows A, A must not be the celeb

therefore, so we can use a for loop to check if the adjacent people(a,b) knows each other, and at the same time update the variable 'celeb' to B if A knows B.

But that only verify B does not garantee B is the celeb, so we need another forloop to check b with everyone else.


### Solution I
```java
public class Solution extends Relation {
  public int findCelebrity(int n){
    Deque<Integer> queue = new ArrayDeque<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++ ) {
      queue.addLast(i);
    }

    while (queue.size()> 1){
      int a = queue.removeFirst();
      int b = queue.removeFirst();

      if (kows(a,b)) {
        queue.addLast(b);
      } else {
        queue.addLast(a);
      }
    }

    int celeb = queue.removeFirst();
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
      if (i != celeb) {
        if (know(celeb, i) || !knows(i, celeb)) {
          return -1;
        }
      }
    }

    return true;
  }
}

```

### Solution II
```java
public class Solution extends Relation {
  public int findCelebrity(int n){
    int celeb = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < n ; i++ ) {
      if (knows(celeb, i)) {
        celeb = i;
      }
    }

    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
      if (i != celeb) {
        if (know(celeb, i) || !knows(i, celeb)) {
          return -1;
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

```

### Takeaways
* Use stack（LIFO） or queue（FIFO） to store data. 缓存模型 cache model
